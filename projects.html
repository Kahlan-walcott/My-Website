                <h2>A Dog's Journey Home</h2>
                <p class="intro">This project was for my Software Engineering course
                    project at GVSU.<br><br>Description:<br>In this adventure game, players guide a
                    resurrected dog through two distinct levels of mystical forests, each
                    filled with unique challenges. The first forest is haunted by ghosts,
                    while the second is plagued by sea monsters. The dog must collect specific
                    artifacts in each level to progress, with the ability to jump, fly, and
                    move back and forth between levels to retrieve missed items. Once all the
                    required artifacts are collected, the dog can advance to the second level,
                    and ultimately, after overcoming the challenges of the sea monster-infested
                    forest, return home to its owner. The game blends exploration and platforming 
                    to create a deeply emotional and dynamic journey.<br><br>
